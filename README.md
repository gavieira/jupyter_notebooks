# jupyter_notebooks
Code and notes on various topics.

Many of the modules/functionalities covered here are not available in most python instalations (such as Biopython and Pandas modules).  

So, always remember to install the modules that are being imported in the beggining of the notebooks. You can do so with [pip](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#use-pip-for-installing) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-packages).
